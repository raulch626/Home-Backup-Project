## Home-Backup-Project
These are the various tools that I am using to automate and schedule a regular backup of my home files.

#These is a list of the portable hard disks that I am using, along with their respective use cases:

-SSD Hard disk (the main source hard disk for my current files and folders)

-1 TB Touru hard disk (serves as a mirror to the SSD hard disk - stored offsite at my office)

-8 TB Easy Store hard disk (all files, old and new, are all stored here)

-3 TB Free Store hard disk (same as the Easy Store)


#Batch files have been created in order to automate the backup from the Google Drive accounts to the SSD hard drive.
  - a_allbackup auto backs up new files from the Google Drive accounts, to the SSD hard drive.
  - allbackup also backups up new file from the Google Drive account, to the SSD hard drive, but this time it pauses on each account before it proceeds to the next backup.
