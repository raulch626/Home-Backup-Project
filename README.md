# Home-Backup-Project
These are the various tools that I am using to automate and schedule a regular backup of my home files.

These is a list of the portable hard disks that I am using, along with their respective use cases:
-SSD Hard disk (the main source hard disk for my current files and folders)
-1 TB Touru hard disk (serves as a mirror to the SSD hard disk - stored offsite at Raul's office)
-8 TB Easy Store hard disk (all files, old and new, are all stored here)
-3 TB Free Store hard disk (same as the Easy Store)
